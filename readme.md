## Getting started

Make sure you have [Npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

Run the `npm run gulp watch` command. Make sure your local server is live (e.g., if you are using MAMP, make sure to lauch it and start the server).
