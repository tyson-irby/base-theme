## Setup
We use the Cody House framework for our sites. Follow the [Using CodyFrame with WordPress](https://codyhouse.co/ds/docs/framework#wp) instructions. 

**Helpful Hints**
When it instructs you to open your `gulpfile.js` and modify `var themeName = 'codyframe-wp'; // use your WP theme folder name`, the wp theme folder name is not your theme name, it's the name of your projects root directory.
